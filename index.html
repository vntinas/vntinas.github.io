      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>
        I was born in Xanthi, Greece on 7 November 1992. I received my <u>Diploma</u> (Diploma/Master of Engineering) in <i>Electrical and
        Computer Engineering (ECE)</i> from the Department of ECE at <i>Democritus University of Thrace (DUTh)</i>, Xanthi, Greece in July
         2015. I was in the top ~1-2% of my class and I received the Best Diploma Thesis Award of the department. In May 2017, I completed my <u>Master of Science (M.Sc.)</u>
        on <i>“Microelectronics and Computer Systems”</i> in the scientific field of <i>"Biologically Inspired Electronic Circuit and
        Systems"</i> at the same department, with the main object of interest the Analogue and Digital Memristive Circuits. Recently,
        I received the <u>Ph.D. degree</u> in <i>Electronic Engineering</i> from the <i>Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)</i> and in ECE from <i>DUTh</i>,
        under the co-supervision of <a href="https://hipics.upc.edu/en/people/faculty/a-rubio" target="_blank">Prof. Antonio Rubio (UPC)</a> 
        and <a href="http://gsirak.ee.duth.gr/" target="_blank">Prof. Georgios Ch. Sirakoulis (DUTh)</a>. During my doctoral studies,
        I have explored stochasticity-related phenomena in various memristor aspects, from device modeling and memristor programming up to
        computing architecture level. After that, I was employed as Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Chair of Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering, 
        <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/iee/ge/die-professur/beschaeftigte" target="_blank">Prof. Ronald Tetzlaff</a>, 
        working at the German Research Foundation (DFG) funded project, Mem<sup>2</sup>CNN, part of the DFG priority program 
        <a href="https://memristec.de/en/" target="_blank">“Memristive Devices Toward Smart Technical Systems” (SPP 2262)</a>. 
        Currently, I joined the <a href="https://www.es.aau.dk/research/edge-computing-and-networking" target="_blank">Edge Computing and Networking Group</a> of the 
        <a href="https://www.es.aau.dk" target="_blank">Department of Electronic Systems</a> at <a href="https://www.en.aau.dk" target="_blank">Aalborg University</a> 
        as an Assistant Professor with Tenure-Track.
        My research interests focus on memristor-based computing architectures for Edge Intelligence, including modeling of memristive devices, stochastic phenomena in 
        memristor systems, and unconventional computing paradigms based on locally-interconnected dynamical networks such as cellular nonlinear networks and cellular automata.</h4>

                    <div id="abstract0" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">In this work, we introduce a high speed and area efficient Cellular Nonlinear Network (CNN) cell, featuring two circuit variants that utilize threshold switches. The threshold switch (TS) model employed represents a current-controlled nanoscale negative differential resistance (NDR) device which exhibits an S-shaped DC I-V curve as a fingerprint. The proposed cell can be considered as the dual of the standard isolated CNN cell where the bistable cell characteristics, originating from the N-shaped voltage-controlled resistor, is implemented through the S-shaped current-controlled TSs. Similarly, the dynamics induced by the parallel capacitor accompanying the nonlinear resistor in the standard cell version are implemented through the internal inductive dynamics of the TSs, resulting in area and speed efficiency. The proposed CNN cell employs a DC voltage source, two bias resistors and 2 TSs, and essentially, features a differential-mode operation which helps to endow it with a symmetric DC I-V characteristic, as is the case for the standard CNN cell. The differential-mode approach further introduces design flexibility as the cell DC I-V characteristic can be adjusted by tuning circuit parameters. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed cell by implementing image processing tasks ranging from edge detection and thresholding to logic AND and OR operations.</div>

For example, this occurs when a constant voltage, let fall across a two-element one-port, composed of its series connection with a suitable linear resistor, stabilizes its bias point on a branch of the respective DC current-voltage characteristic, along which the slope assumes negative values. Around a bias point of this kind, the device may act as a source of local energy, justifying the locally-active attribute it is conferred. In past research studies the capability of the nanodevice to generate infinitesimal energy around a NDR bias point was exploited to induce the emergence of dramatic local phenomena in otherwise-dumb circuits, including the Hopf Supercritical and Pitchfork Bifurcations, which, while destabilizing a quiescent steady state, respectively spawn sine-wave-alike oscillations, or two new stable quiescent points, concurrently. In this research study, the local energy, which the switch releases about the NDR bias point, when a small-signal sine wave signal, superimposed on top of the DC stimulus, is applied across the two-element one-port, is leveraged to induce the development of larger oscillations across the resistor than those generated by the input source. While the key findings of our numerical investigations are provided here, the underlying theoretical analysis, supported by experimental verification, shall be reported in a Journal paper.</div>

                    <div id="abstract2" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">This manuscript sheds light into the fundamental importance of the Principles of Local Activity and Edge of Chaos for the future design of innovative circuits, which, employing biomimetic memristive devices, are ideally suited for the development of energy-efficient artificially-intelligent technical systems. The focus of the work is the design of a Second-Order Reactance-Less Oscillator, across which oscillations may develop if and only if at least one of its two different volatile thermally-activated memristor physical realizations is biased along a negative differential resistance branch of the respective DC locus, which turns it into a source of local energy. Very importantly, the proposed cell is first found to lock in the oscillatory mode out of a local Hopf Supercritical Bifurcation when its design parameters are chosen from the Edge of Chaos region, providing clear evidence for the high degree of excitability it acquires as a result.</div>

Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Networks (M-CNNs) offer a promising path forward, leveraging the unique properties of memristors for adaptable and scalable computation. This paper presents a study of novel M-CNN cell configurations designed to enhance computational versatility and address operational challenges in M-CNN-based systems. By leveraging memristor technology within CNN cells, we propose three distinct configurations: (1) incorporating parallel and series resistive elements for refined control over cell dynamics, (2) introducing a fixed bias voltage to expand computational capabilities, and (3) integrating the Full-Range CNN (FR-CNN) model into M-CNNs for the first time. The proposed topologies are evaluated through dynamic route maps (DRM) and vector field analysis to systematically assess stability and performance across varying design parameters.</div>

                    <div id="abstract5" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">As demand grows for efficient edge computing systems, innovative architectures are crucial for achieving low-power, high-density data processing in resource-constrained environments. Compressed sensing (CS) and Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC) offer promising pathways to meet these needs by enabling localized, efficient feature extraction and inference. This paper introduces an energy-efficient on-chip system that integrates CS with AIMC based on Phase-Change Memory (PCM) devices to enable robust feature extraction and inference. The proposed architecture employs CS for dimensionality reduction at the sensor level, generating low-dimensional feature vectors directly fed into a single-layer artificial neural network (ANN) implemented on PCM crossbars. To address inherent hardware non-idealities, we utilize hardware-aware (HWA) training combined with an attention-based regularization mechanism, improving both inference stability and drift resilience over extended periods. Performance evaluation on a face recognition task demonstrates that attention-enhanced HWA training effectively mitigates overfitting and maintains model accuracy under PCM drift conditions, highlighting the system's suitability for edge computing applications requiring low power consumption and long-term reliability.</div>

                    <div id="abstract6" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Neuromorphic circuits using emerging memory technologies have recently gained popularity since they facilitate dense integration with reduced design complexity. In this work, we introduce a simplified modeling approach for the analysis of threshold switch (TS) based neuron circuits where, under given constraints, we represent the TS device as a nonlinear resistor in series with a parasitic inductor. As a result, we define the current of the TS as its state variable. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we analyze the conventional Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron circuit along with two of its modified variants. We validate the accuracy of the provided analysis and key predictions through numerical simulation results. As a significant contribution, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in modifying the nullclines of the TS based LIF neuron and qualitatively align them with the nullclines of a 2nd order biologically plausible neuron model.</div>

                    <div id="abstract7" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Realized memristors exhibit a unique phenomenon called the fading memory effect, where the memristor response to an AC signal is determined by its characteristics (waveform, amplitude, frequency, and DC offset) rather than the memristor initial conditions. Recently, a method for programming Hewlett Packard’s TaOx memristor to a target state was proposed, involving configuring the DC offset of a high-frequency square-wave AC voltage input. This served as a basic application example that exploits fading memory in non-volatile memristors, but didn’t consider non-ideal effects. Here, we assess the method applicability in a HfOx-based VCM resistive switch from Forschungszentrum Julich incorporating a variability-aware physics-based model.</div>

                    <div id="abstract8" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNNs) are a well established computing approach in the domain of analog computing, known for massive parallelism and data processing locality that enable efficient hardware implementations. Combining CNN with non-volatile memristive devices holds the promise to overcome technological hurdles, like scalability issues, and high energy consumption, while also introducing richer dynamics into the field of CNN. Memristive devices based on the valence change mechanism (VCM) show great properties, like bipolar switching, tuneable resistance and non-volatility that are essential for the design of memristive CNN (M-CNN). In this study we design and investigate an uncoupled M-CNN cell implementing the EDGE detection task. This is the first paper investigating the resilience of M-CNN against device-to-device variability. To this end the first experimentally acquired Dynamic Route Map (DRM) of the M-CNN cell is employed. The comparison with simulations results allows for investigating the effect of mechanisms in the VCM device on the performance of the cell. The result of the computation is stored in the VCM device despite the unavoidable variability in the electrical behaviors of different device samples. Furthermore, the theoretically predicted richer dynamics of M-CNNs over traditional CNNs is demonstrated. This work provides crucial insights into design considerations of M-CNNs, especially as here first steps towards the comprehensive analysis on the effect of imperfections and variability of the memristor on M-CNN cell are taken.</div>

                    <div id="abstract9" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Noise is a pervasive aspect that impacts various systems and environments, from mobile radio channels to biological systems. Within the framework of complex networks, noise poses significant challenges for functionality and performance. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a well-known type of locally-coupled computing networks, Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Networks (M-CNNs), in the presence of noise at their interconnection weights, introducing the concept of stochastic weights. In particular, we analyze the effect of noise originating from the synaptic memristors by incorporating both deterministic and stochastic components into synaptic weights, investigating how device-to-device variability and noise affect network performance. Based on the well-established theory of CNNs, we are extending the stability criteria to incorporate synaptic memristor non-idealities and we provide a theoretical framework to analyze their effect on system's performance. In this work, we employ the physics-based Jülich Aachen Resistive Switching Tools (JART) model to study Valence Change Memory (VCM) devices as synapses within our theoretical framework. We investigate the impact of device variability and noise, utilizing statistical properties derived from experimental data reported in the literature. We demonstrate the efficacy of noisy M-CNNs in performing the edge detection task, an example of fundamental image processing applications.</div>

                    <div id="abstract10" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The Hodgkin-Huxley model is an accurate yet convoluted mathematical description of the complex nonlinear dynamics of a biological neuronal axon. Employing four degrees of freedom, three of which embodied by the sodium and potassium memristive ion channels, it is capable to capture the cascade of three fundamental bifurcations, specifically a Hopf supercritical, a Hopf subcritical, and a saddle-node limit cycle bifurcation, marking the life cycle from birth to extinction via All-to-None effect of an electrical spike, also referred to as Action Potential in the literature, across biological axon membranes under monotonic change in the net synaptic current. This paper recurs to powerful concepts from the Local Activity and Edge of Chaos Principle and to methods from Circuit Theory and Nonlinear Dynamics to design the first and simplest ever-reported electrical circuit, which, leveraging the peculiar Negative Differential Resistance effects in a volatile NbOx threshold switch from NaMLab, and including additionally just one capacitor and one DC current source in its minimal topology, undergoes the three-bifurcation cascade, emerging across the fourth-order Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model under monotonic current sweep, while requiring half the number of degrees of freedom, which reveals the promising potential of Memristors on “Edge of Chaos” for energy-efficient bio-inspired electronics.</div>

                    <div id="abstract11" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Cellular Automata (CAs) have emerged as one of the most straightforward computational models, distinguished by their proven capabilities to effectively simulate various complex physical systems and processes. CAs have two important properties-intrinsic parallelism and locality-that make them perfect for real-world computer architectures. They also make it easier for data to move between dedicated memory and processing cores, which is known as the von Neumann bottleneck. To leverage these advantages, extensive research has been conducted over the past decades, focusing on appropriate computer architectures, hardware implementations, and VLSI/FPGA applications. This chapter delves into the CAs and their abilities to deal with the aforementioned bottleneck, offering enhanced performance, especially when coupled with appropriate nanoelectronic, VLSI and FPGA technologies, circuits, and architectures. At the same time, the fact that CAs can be used for many different types of physical modeling tasks has led to the creation of many separate hardware implementations that aim to improve the performance of CA models in fields like physics, chemistry, ecology, geology, biology, and computer science. Furthermore, researchers have recently looked into new ways of doing things, like using memristors, oscillating circuits, quantum cellular automata (CA), and Graphene-based CA to build advanced hybrid CAs. These innovative methods hold the potential to further advance the pronounced capabilities of CAs, offering new dimensions of efficiency and functionality. Consequently, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of CAs hardware also with a special emphasis on these recent advancements and their potential to revolutionize CA applications.</div>

                    <div id="abstract13" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Due to the rise in data-intensive applications, the von Neumann bottleneck is increasingly restricting modern computer architectures, resulting to latency and energy consumption. Addressing this challenge necessitates a CMOS-compatible solution with high energy efficiency and significant parallelism. Utilizing resistive switching components within a 1T1R crossbar array and the application of Stanford RRAM model, this paper suggests an original method for in-memory computing. Moreover, this work shows a new way to advance the popular RISC-V architecture by including memristive crossbar array. It does this by adding a custom instruction set, special hardware blocks, and the Scouting Logic Scheme. These modifications serve both as a comprehensive testbed for the memory system and a proof of concept for the future integration of memristors in computing architectures. The proposed design undergoes extensive testing and power analysis to validate its functionality and performance under various conditions. The results demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency and energy savings, highlighting the potential of memristor-based in-memory computing systems to overcome current architectural limitations.</div>

The SR impact on the binary spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocol at the device level was investigated. We demonstrate that the two extreme conductance states of the device that represent the synaptic weights in neuromorphic systems can be better distinguished with the incorporation of Gaussian noise into the bias signal. This technique allows setting the memristor conductance which is directly related to the overlap between the pre- and postsynaptic pulses. The study is reproduced in the LTSPICE simulator using the dynamic memdiode model (DMM) for memristors.</div>

                    <div id="abstract15" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The implementation of modern complex machine learning algorithms on a conventional von Neumann architecture faces severe challenges to maintain efficiency in terms of energy consumption, memory requirement, and latency. Data-centric architectures result in a more appropriate alternative to exploit the inherent parallelism of multidimensional sensory signals. A viable implementation alternative is based on memristor crossbars. Matrix-vector multiplication, which is one resource-hungry operation in conventional architectures, can be performed by memristor crossbar arrays by using very limited resources. In this work, we explore the implementation of a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) on a differential memristor crossbar array. The Voltage Threshold Adaptive Memristor (VTEAM) model has been employed for the simulation of memristor behavior. The feature vector for SVM has been produced by a compressed sensing based vision sensor architecture. The weights of the ex situ trained SVM, are mapped to the device physical parameters to achieve the equivalent conductance. As a case study, the proposed scheme has been tested for face recognition against a widely accepted face dataset.</div>

We show that a cell within the array equipped with an NbO2-based volatile threshold switch can exhibit both oscillatory and static dynamics depending on the parameters of the Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Network.

System-theoretic methods are applied to the physics-based model of the ReRAM cell under consideration to explore the origin of the local fading memory and its robustness against the intrinsic cycle-to-cycle variability of the device.

                    <div id="abstract18" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The theoretical study performed in this paper demonstrates that the NbO2-Mott memristor considered here could exhibit two distinct steady-state responses when stimulated by a sinusoidal current input of suitable amplitude, provided the input frequency is sufficiently high. By utilizing methods from circuit theory, this work establishes a link between the two possible dynamical regimes observed in this nanodevice, under the assumed simulation settings hereby, and a versatile dynamical phenomenon it exhibits, known as local fading memory. The mechanisms driving local fading memory in the high frequency limit are investigated here analytically. This feature of the NbO2-Mott memristor, revealed through our analyses, if further validated through experimental studies, could further enhance the already established versatility of this device and may be exploited in suitable practical applications.</div>

                    <div id="abstract19" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">In this theoretical study, the high-frequency response of the electrothermal NbO2-Mott threshold switch is focused, a real-world electronic device, which has been proved to be relevant in several applications and is classified as a volatile memristor. Memristors of this kind, have been shown to exhibit distinctive non-linear behaviors crucial for cutting-edge neuromorphic circuits. In accordance with well-established models for these devices, their resistances depend on their body temperatures, which evolve over time following Newton's Law of Cooling. Here, it is demonstrated that HP's NbO2-Mott memristor can manifest up to three distinct steady-state oscillatory behaviors under a suitable high-frequency periodic voltage input, showcasing increased versatility despite its volatile nature. Additionally, when subjected to a high-frequency periodic voltage signal, the device body temperature oscillates with a negligible peak-to-peak amplitude. Since the temperature remains almost constant over an input cycle, the devices under study behave as linear resistors during each input cycle. Based on these insights, this paper presents analytical equations characterizing the response of the NbO2-Mott memristor to high-frequency voltage inputs, demarcating regions in the state space where distinct initial conditions lead to various asymptotic oscillatory behaviors. Importantly, the mathematical methods introduced in this manuscript are applicable to any volatile electrothermal resistive switch. Additionally, this work presents analytical equations that accurately reproduce the temperature time-waveform of the studied device during both its transient and steady-state phases when subjected to a zero-mean sinusoidal voltage input oscillating in the high-frequency limit. This analytical approach not only increases the comprehension of volatile electrothermal memristors but also provides a theoretical framework to harness the enhanced dynamical capabilities of real-world volatile memristors in practical applications.</div>

                    <div id="abstract20" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Chimera states have attracted significant research interest due to their potential in modeling brain network functionality. Memristive nano-crossbars, known for their energy efficiency, massive parallelism, and synaptic-like properties, serve as a promising coupling medium in brain-inspired applications. The operation of these devices is strongly dictated by the non-linear mechanisms of memristor devices when studying synchronization phenomena. Expanding upon our previous work, which explored sneak-path currents in Chimera states, this study investigates the impact of fabricated Silicon Nitride (SiN) devices on the dynamics of Chua circuit (CC) networks. We conducted experimental evaluations to confirm the ability of SiN devices to retain their resistance state, thereby ensuring consistency in the crossbar array, a critical factor in maintaining chimera states during experiments. We employed an exponential memristor model to further investigate the non-linear dynamics within the CC network. Our results not only confirm the formation of various synchronization structures, such as chimera states and full chaotic synchronization but also reveal the intriguing formation of phase-lag structures. These structures, induced by the SiN-fitted model, exhibit distinctive characteristics marked by subtle and non-linear coupling behaviors, particularly evident at near-zero voltages. After analyzing our results, we present a comprehensive phase-parametric regime map, obtained by varying the coupling strength bifurcation parameter. This map provides valuable insights into the mechanisms governing the dynamics of CC networks equipepd with SiN-based memristor nanodevices, which have proven capable of capturing the complex dynamics of chimera states.</div>

Averaging the model state equation in time, a rigorous methodol-ogy is developed to identify all the admissible levels, around which the memory state of the non-volatile memristor may oscillate asymptotically.

                    <div id="abstract24" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">This paper introduces an innovative graphical anal-ysis tool for investigating the dynamics of Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Networks (M-CNNs) featuring 2nd-order processing elements, known as M-CNN cells. In the era of specialized hardware catering to the demands of intelligent autonomous systems, the integration of memristors within Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNNs) has emerged as a promising paradigm due to their exceptional characteristics. However, the standard Dynamic Route Map (DRM) analysis, applicable to 1st-order systems, fails to address the intricacies of 2nd -order M-CNN cell dynamics, as well the 2nd-order DRM (DRM2) exhibits limitations on the graphical illustration of local dynamical properties of the M-CNN cells, e.g. state derivative's magnitude. To address this limitation, we propose a novel integration of M-CNN cell vector field into the cell's phase portrait, enhancing the analysis efficacy and enabling efficient M-CNN cell design. A comprehensive exploration of M- CNN cell dynamics is presented, showcasing the utility of the proposed graphical tool for various scenarios, including bistable and monostable behavior, and demonstrating its superior ability to reveal subtle variations in cell behavior. Through this work, we offer a refined perspective on the analysis and design of M-CNNs, paving the way for advanced applications in edge computing and specialized hardware.</div>

                    <div id="abstract25" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Accurate and computationally cost-efficient models for fabricated memristor devices are essential for the design of future computers and AI-driven sensor-processor systems, especially for the simulation of large-scale circuits and systems. The variability-aware JART memristor model properly captures both the conduction mechanisms and the dynamical behavior of actual Valence Change Mechanism (VCM) memristors. However, the original JART VCM model incorporates an implicit description of the memristor current that constitutes a computationally heavy approach. Here, we aim to simplify the JART VCM model by replacing this implicit description with an explicit mathematical expression, leading to faster simulations and enabling deeper theoretical studies. The improvement achieved using the proposed model goes over x20 in simulation speed for increasing number of VCM devices, allowing for faster simulation of computing-inmemory and memristor-based AI systems.</div>

                    <div id="abstract26" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Networks (M-CNNs) represent a significant leap in computational technology compared to traditional Cellular Nonlinear Networks (CNNs), thanks to their multi-tasking and memcomputing capabilities. Recent studies have demonstrated various configurations of M-CNNs that utilize these capabilities to perform image processing tasks. This paper employs the Dynamic Route Map circuit-theoretic analysis tool to investigate the dynamic features of M-CNNs and shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for their ability to handle multiple tasks. The findings from this theoretical study offer valuable insights for the development of more compact and highly efficient data processing M-CNNs that possess such versatile properties.</div>

                    <div id="abstract27" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Very recently, a deep numerical investigation of resistance switching phenomena in a TaOxReRAM cell from Forschungszentrum Jülich, based on a predictive physics-based model, uncovered the capability of the nano-device to exhibit one of two possible steady-state oscillatory behaviours, depending upon the initial condition, under specific AC periodic triangular wave stimuli. In these circumstances, however, one of the two oscillations in the device memory state, was found to hit cyclically the lower bound in the existence domain of the model solution. Out of a thorough numerical exploration of the model, guided by system-theoretic considerations based upon the Time Average State Dynamic Route tool, this paper shows that it is indeed possible to shape the parameters of an AC periodic pulse train excitation signal so that each of the two locally-stable oscillatory response solutions for the memory state of the ReRAM cell lie well within the range of admissible values.</div>

                    <div id="abstract28" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">In this paper, the design of an isolated Memristor Cellular Nonlinear Network (CNN) cell with discrete electronic elements is presented. The proposed versatile circuit allows for adjustable cell dynamical characteristics, controlled by design parameters, while the discrete element approach enables simple on-board implementation without the need for large-scale integration, which is necessary for testing hardware with individual fabricated memristors. A voltage-mode approach, that makes use of the diversity of operational amplifiers, is preferred here over a current-mode one that necessitates a large number of individual transistors. The dynamical properties of the system are initially investigated through the calculation of equilibrium points and further illustrated applying the concept of State Dynamic Routes (SDRs) for the cell assuming that the memristor dynamics are much slower than the capacitor voltage dynamics. Moreover, the effect of design parameters on the cell dynamics is being investigated, showing how the scaling of the operating voltage, as well as a plethora of CNN variants –i.e., the ChuaYang and Full Range models–, can be implemented within the same design. Finally, the nonlinear conductance properties of real memristor devices are incorporated into the study, demonstrating interesting bifurcation phenomena between the cell monostability and bistability for specific parameter values.</div>

                    <div id="abstract29" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The memristor crossbar architecture is a new technology that combines memory and computing on the same chip, finding numerous applications in modern bio-inspired computing systems. Recently, memristor-coupled Chua Circuit Networks (MCCNs) have been developed for the experimental confirmation of collective nonlinear phenomena, such as chimera states, that are also observed in the brain. For highly dense topologies, however, memristor crossbars can be prone to certain vulnerabilities. In this paper, we investigate the impact of sneak-path currents (SPCs) on the collective behaviors of chaotic oscillator networks, uncovering the network's tolerance to various realistic memristor crossbar designs. Despite the fact that these states alter the synchronization regime map, our findings suggest that SPCs have no detrimental impact on the formation and stability of single or multiple chimera states. This coupling issue along with other possible challenges are thoroughly discussed with a focus on nonlinear dynamics, highlighting the reliability of memristor crossbars as a coupling mechanism for studying chimera states.</div>

                    <div id="abstract30" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Biological synapses behave as dynamically-rich nonlinear elements, participating in complicated computing tasks through their adaptation due to external stimuli. Such adaptivity constitutes an intrinsic property of non-volatile memristor devices, which are also able to maintain their internal state, under zero input, enabling novel bio-inspired learning operations. In this work, a synaptic element based on a memristive bridge, containing two resistors and two memristors, is studied, aiming to investigate complex memristor-based topologies that may result in rich synaptic dynamics. The proposed memristive bridge allows the realization of both positive and negative synaptic weights, while an asymmetric tuning of a weight, stemming from memristor's features and bridge topology, is demonstrated. In particular, by properly selecting the memristor's position and polarity within the bridge, different tuning behaviors have been observed, showcasing versatile learning properties of the topology. Along with the synaptic weight tuning, the read overall process of the synaptic weight, necessary for inference operations, is also investigated. We explore the dynamics of the bridge via numerical simulations.</div>

                    <div id="abstract31" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The so far dominant Von Neumann architecture is being challenged by the energy demanding communication bottle-neck between processing and memory units. To address this issue, in-memory computing is employed for their co-location, with memristive crossbar arrays playing an important role towards this goal. Motivated by the above, this work introduces a timing-based programming of a memristor crossbar array for sequence generation in Stochastic Computing (SC). Its operation principle is based on the stochastic nature of the memristor devices forming the crossbar array, where their programming is regulated by the switching probability that follows the Poisson distribution, controlled by pulse amplitude and duration. The timing-based programming of the proposed crossbar array increases the discretization levels of the output probability values, thereby offering more accurate control when compared to programming schemes that consider only the pulse amplitude. The memristor's stochasticity along with the crossbar's inherent parallelism opens the in-memory design space allowing SC elements to be used as sequences are generated efficiently. Simulation results on different programming pulse-width precisions highlight the proposed crossbar's effectiveness in sequence generation, supported by mean absolute error (MAE) results in a standard SC arithmetic operation. Process variations stemming from the crossbar array affecting the sequence generation in SC are investigated.</div>

                    <div id="abstract32" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The development of novel hardware computing systems and methods has been a topic of increased interest for researchers worldwide. New materials, devices, and architectures are being explored as a means to deliver more efficient solutions to contemporary issues. Along with the advancement of technology, there is a continuous increase in methods available to address significant challenges. However, the increased needs to be fulfilled have also led to problems of increasing complexity that require better and faster computing and processing capabilities. Moreover, there is a wide range of problems in several applications that cannot be addressed using the currently available methods and tools. As a consequence, the need for emerging and more efficient computing methods is of utmost importance and constitutes a topic of active research. Among several proposed solutions, we distinguish the development of a novel nanoelectronic device, called a “memristor”, that can be utilized both for storing and processing, and thus it has emerged as a promising circuit element for the design of compact and energy-efficient circuits and systems. The memristor has been proposed for a wide range of applications. However, in this work, we focus on its use in computing architectures based on the concept of Cellular Automata. The combination of the memristor’s performance characteristics with Cellular Automata has boosted further the concept of processing and storing information on the same physical units of a system, which has been extensively studied in the literature as it provides a very good candidate for the implementation of Cellular Automata computing with increased potential and improved characteristics, compared to traditional hardware implementations. In this context, this paper reviews the most recent advancements toward the development of Cellular-Automata-based computing coupled with memristor devices. Several approaches for the design of such novel architectures, called “Memristive Cellular Automata”, exist in the literature. This extensive review provides a thorough insight into the most important developments so far, helping the reader to grasp all the necessary information, which is here presented in an organized and structured manner. Thus, this article aims to pave the way for further development in the field and to bring attention to technological aspects that require further investigation.</div>

                    <div id="abstract33" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Inspired by the behavior of natural systems, Cellular Automata (CA) tackle the demanding long-distance information transfer of conventional computers by the massive parallel computation performed by a set of locally-coupled dynamical nodes. Although CA are envisioned as powerful deterministic computers, their intrinsic capabilities are expanded after the memristor’s probabilistic switching is introduced into CA cells, resulting in new hybrid deterministic and probabilistic memristor-based CA (MemCA). In the proposed MemCA hardware realization, memristor devices are incorporated in both the cell and rule modules, composing the very first all-memristor CA hardware, designed with mixed CMOS/Memristor circuits. The proposed implementation accomplishes high operating speed and reduced area requirements, exploiting also memristor as an entropy source in every CA cell. MemCA’s functioning is showcased in deterministic and probabilistic operation, which can be externally modified by the selection of programming voltage amplitude, without changing the design. Also, the proposed MemCA system includes a reconfigurable rule module implementation that allows for spatial and temporal rule inhomogeneity.</div>

                    <div id="abstract34" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">There is a growing interest in quantum computers and quantum algorithm development. It has been proved that ideal quantum computers, with zero error rates and large decoherence times, can solve problems that are intractable for today’s classical computers. Quantum computers use two resources, superposition and entanglement, that have no classical analog. Since quantum computer platforms that are currently available comprise only a few dozen of qubits, the use of quantum simulators is essential in developing and testing new quantum algorithms. We present a novel quantum simulator based on memristor crossbar circuits and use them to simulate well-known quantum algorithms, namely the Deutsch and Grover quantum algorithms. In quantum computing the dominant algebraic operations are matrix-vector multiplications. The execution time grows exponentially with the simulated number of qubits, causing an exponential slowdown in quantum algorithm execution using classical computers. In this work, we show that the inherent characteristics of memristor arrays can be used to overcome this problem and that memristor arrays can be used not only as independent quantum simulators but also as a part of a quantum computer stack where classical computers accelerators are connected. Our memristive crossbar circuits are re-configurable and can be programmed to simulate any quantum algorithm.</div>

Our results reveal a hidden property of the Dynamic Route Map (DRM) system-theoretic analysis tool, i.e. its capability to predict accurately the mean value of the state variable oscillation in first-order non-volatile memristors, at steady-state, as a function of the input amplitude alone. This DRM property may be useful in real-world memristor-based applications, where voltage pulses are most often employed to modulate the states of practical memristor devices.</div>

                Nowadays, the huge power consumption and the inability of the conventional circuits to deal with real-time classification tasks have necessitated the devising of new electronic devices with inherent neuromorphic functionalities. Resistive switching memories arise as an ideal candidate due to their low footprint and small leakage current dissipation, while their intrinsic randomness is smoothly leveraged for implementing neuromorphic functionalities. In this review, valence change memories (VCM) or conductive bridge memories (CBRAM) for emulating neuromorphic characteristics are demonstrated. Moreover, the impact of the device structure and the incorporation of \$Pt\$ nanoparticles (NPs) is thoroughly investigated. Interestingly, our devices possess the ability to emulate various artificial synaptic functionalities, including paired-pulsed facilitation and paired-pulse depression, long-term plasticity and four different types of spike-dependent plasticity. Our approach provides valuable insights from a material design point of view towards the development of multifunctional synaptic elements that operate with low power consumption and exhibit biological-like behavior.</div>

                    <div id="abstract38" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Unconventional and, speciﬁcally, wave computing has been repeatedly studied in laboratory based experiments by utilizing chemical systems like a thin ﬁlm of Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reactions. Nonetheless, the principles demonstrated by this chemical computer were mimicked by mathematical models to enhance the understanding of these systems and enable a more detailed investigation of their capacity. As expected, the computerized counterparts of the laboratory based experiments are faster and less expensive. A further step of acceleration in wave-based computing is the development of electrical circuits that imitate the dynamics of chemical computers. A key component of the electrical circuits is the memristor which facilitates the non-linear behavior of the chemical systems. As part of this concept, the road-map of the inspiration from wave-based computing on chemical media towards the implementation of equivalent systems on oscillating memristive circuits was studied here. For illustration reasons, the most straightforward example was demonstrated, namely the approximation of Boolean gates.</div>

                    <div id="abstract39" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Concurrent computational machines have not provided in all cases ideal or even efficient implementations for a range of complex and computationally expensive problems. Thus, the utilization of unconventional computing systems, often inspired by biological processes, is widely investigated. One characteristic category of these systems is chemical computers that encode reactants' spatial concentrations as information and employ wave-fronts' propagation as means of computation. The most widely known and used reaction is the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) that perfectly demonstrates non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Motivated by these chemical computers and to further enhance their analysis, a digital-twin was developed and tested. Namely MemRC, a memristor based oscillator is presented here. The ability of the proposed electrical circuitry to mimic the computational abilities of a chemical system was demonstrated by the realization of Fredkin gate operations. The results of the electrical system are in good agreement with results from simulation of the chemical medium and from laboratory experiments. Furthermore an important advantage of the electrical system is the significant acceleration of the computations that can enable further testing of possible implementations.</div>

                    <div id="abstract40" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The threshold switching effect is critical in memristor devices for a range of applications, from crossbar design reliability to simulating neuromorphic features using artificial neural networks. The rich inherit dynamics of a metallic conductive filament (CF) formation are thought to be linked to this characteristic. Simulating these dynamics is necessary to develop an accurate memristor model. In this work we present a compact memristor model that utilizes the drift, diffusion and thermo-diffusion effects. These three effects are taken into consideration to derive the switching behavior of a memristor. The resistance of a memristor is calculated based on the evolution of a truncated cone shaped filament. The objective of this model is to achieve a realistic integration of switching mechanisms of the memristor device, while minimizing the overhead on computing resources and being compatible with circuit design tools. The model incorporates the effect of thermo-diffusion on the switching pattern, providing a different perception of the ionic transport processes, which enable the unipolar switching. SPICE simulation results provide an exact match with experimental results of Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) memristive devices of Ag/Si2/SiO2.07/Pt nanoparticles (NPs) configuration.</div>

                    <div id="abstract41" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">There is a continuous urge for higher efficiency in conventional computing systems, driven by an ever-growing demand for these systems’ complexity to be able to match the one of convoluted and challenging problems. However, this type of problems has formulated the benchmarks for unconventional computing systems to validate their emerging applicability and prove their effectiveness. Towards this path, Cellular Automata (CAs) have been established as a promising mathematical tool for simulating physical processes and demonstrated a favourable methodology for effectively implementing computations in hardware by taking advantage of their inherent parallelism. Representing CAs with oscillating memristive networks could further enhance the performance of these systems, by incorporating the rich dynamics evident in memristors and their strong memory and computing features. In this work, a wave generator circuit has been designed with low-voltage fabricated CBRAM devices, that is able to act as a Wave Cellular Automaton (WCA). These wave generation units are located on a grid with adjusting multi-directional interconnections between neighbors. In addition to that, the ability to reconFigure the amount of such units that influence each other, facilitates the propagation of voltage signals through the grid following wave propagation features. An example of this computational domain is presented with the realization of complex logic gates on the grid of WCAs.</div>

The addition of an external gaussian noise to the bias circuitry positively impacts the memristors characteristics by increasing the OFF/ON resistances ratio. The known stochastic resonance effect has been observed, when changing the standard deviation of the noise. The influence of the additive noise on the memristor current-voltage characteristic and on the set and reset related parameters are also presented.</div>

                    <div id="abstract43" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Memristors are promising nanoelectronic devices for the implementation of future AI-driven sensor-processor electronic systems, which are essential for the ongoing digitalization of our world. Accurate and computationally cost-effective models for the manufactured memristors are essential for the design of such systems, especially for the simulation of large circuits. In this work we address the simplification of the JART memristor model, a generic physics-based model of Valence Change Mechanism (VCM) memristors which accurately describes the dynamic behavior of fabricated memristor devices. Furthermore, the proposed model and simplification methodology have the potential to capture the dynamics of a wide range of memristor devices. Importantly, the implicit description of the current through the memristor is replaced by an explicit mathematical relationship. The proper reproduction of memristor dynamics, verified by applying the system-theoretic Dynamic Route Map (DRM) graphical analysis tool, applicable to first-order systems, can be observed through the proposed simplified model and enables the time-efficient simulation of large arrays of VCM devices.</div>

                    <div id="abstract45" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Self-selective memory devices are considered promising candidates for suppressing the undesired sneak path currents that appear within crossbar memory structures and compromise their performance during the write and read operations. Along these lines, in this work we present forming free SiO_\mathbf2-based resistive devices with inherent self-selection and self-compliance properties. The devices can operate in dual mode, since they can perform volatile threshold switching and non-volatile bipolar resistive behavior by regulating the external voltage amplitude. Interestingly, the devices exhibit low operating voltage (\sim260 – 360 mV) and quick response time (\sim100 ns). A comprehensive model is then developed in order to interpret this unique feature and provide valuable insights into the underlying physical mechanisms. Additionally, self-activated neural networks are theoretically investigated by performing in-situ digital and analog computations, whereas the calculated outcomes are compared with traditional neural networks with transistors as selecting elements. More specifically, a logic NAND gate and supervised learning upon the MNIST dataset is performed, while the proposed neural network architecture is tuned differently according to the application. Notably, the acquired results are comparable with the respective data where selectors have been employed, indicating the promising aspects of the proposed memristive devices. Moreover, a thorough analysis is carried out regarding the correlation between the device's linearity and the recognition's accuracy score, offering valuable insights. The proposed architecture paves the way for the development of energy-efficient artificial neural network computing architectures with tunable properties.</div>

                    <div id="abstract46" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">In conventional computing systems, the device imperfections constitute the main hindrance on the commercialization of emerging technologies. On the other hand, in alternative computing paradigms, generally acknowledged as unconventional computing, device imperfections can be utilized to achieve complex behaviors that are computationally hard for conventional computers. In Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA), complex collective phenomena emerge through simplistic locally coupled probabilistic entities, named as cells. However, the hardware implementations of PCA are highly imposed by the required randomness generation within each PCA cell. In this paper, a novel hardware design of 1-D PCA with Memristors is proposed, utilizing device’s non-volatile storage and its unprecedented voltage-controlled probabilistic switching behavior. The necessary theoretical framework for memristor-based PCA (MemPCA) is deﬁned. Moreover, the randomness of MemPCA for various switching probability levels is evaluated through the entropy of generated sequences and the collective effect to all 1-D elementary CA rules is presented, highlighting the effectiveness of memristor as a source of entropy.</div>

                    <div id="abstract47" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Resistance switching devices are of special importance because of their application in resistive memories (RRAM) which are promising candidates for replacing current nonvolatile memories and realize storage class memories. These devices exhibit usually memristive properties with many discrete resistance levels and implement artificial synapses. The last years, researchers have demonstrated memristive chips as accelerators in computing, following new in-memory and neuromorphic computational approaches. Many different metal oxides have been used as resistance switching materials in MIM or MIS structures. Understanding of the mechanism and the dynamics of resistance switching is very critical for the modeling and use of memristors in different applications. Here, we demonstrate the bipolar resistance switching of silicon nitride thin films using heavily doped Si and Cu as bottom and top-electrodes, respectively. Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics reveal that under space-charge limited conditions and appropriate current compliance setting, multilevel resistance operation can be achieved. Furthermore, a flexible tuning protocol for multi-level resistance switching was developed applying appropriate SET/RESET pulse sequences. Retention and random telegraph noise measurements performed at different resistance levels. The present results reveal the attractive properties of the examined devices.</div>

Vision sensors, processors, and hardware accelerators are among the most demanding IoT applications. Resistance switching (RS) two-terminal devices are suitable for resistive RAMs (RRAM), a promising technology to realize storage class memories. Furthermore, due to their memristive nature, RRAMs are appropriate candidates for in-memory computing architectures. Recently, we demonstrated a CMOS compatible silicon nitride (SiNx) MIS RS device with memristive properties. In this paper, a report on a new photodiode-based vision sensor architecture with in-memory computing capability, relying on memristive device, is disclosed. In this context, the resistance switching dynamics of our memristive device were measured and a data-fitted behavioral model was extracted. SPICE simulations were made highlighting the in-memory computing capabilities of the proposed photodiode-one memristor pixel vision sensor. Finally, an integration and manufacturing perspective was discussed.</div>

Unconventional computation functionality has been verified and implemented successfully on chemical reactions, paving the way to the development of Chemical Computers. This functionality is investigated here, aiming to transfer chemical reaction's working principle on a circuit capable of processing information, involving the interaction of propagating voltage signals in a geometrically constrained electrical medium. In this work such a circuit has been developed utilizing Memristor-Resistor-Capacitor (MemRC) oscillators and their computing capabilities have been verified by demonstrating multiple Boolean logic calculations in the same medium. More specifically, a variety of Boolean gates is implemented in a versatile topology of oscillating nodes, exploiting the same electrical medium geometry.</div>

                    <div id="abstract50" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">During the last decade, there is an ever-growing concern regarding the future of CMOS technology, as well as the emerging difficulties on handling upcoming technological issues related with silicon transistors' dimensions, electrical power, energy consumption, and last but not least reaching the physical limits of this technology. At the same time, new computing alternatives beyond the classical computing systems, namely von Neumman architectures, are heavily sought after to tackle energy and memory-wall problems. In this talk, we focus on a hybrid analogue computational circuit-level system with unipolar memristor nanodevices connected in oscillatory networks and based on wave-like propagation of information. These methods are inspired by biochemical processes occurring in nature. The proposed insightful electrochemical wave propagation is apparent in many natural and biological systems and is modelled with powerful, inherently parallel computational tools, like Cellular Automata (CAs). This framework enables us to further proceed into realising alternative types of computations executed on the designed, modelled and fabricated memristor nanodevices, which are finally employed for the design and development of wave based electronic computational units. The proposed nanoelectronic memristive oscillatory networks will be in the advantageous position to perform both classical and unconventional calculations, like multi-digit, in memory and neuromorphic, to name a few of them. Thus, we will have a powerful tool targeting beyond the existing von Neumann information processing techniques and alleviating the aforementioned disadvantages associated with them.</div>

                    <div id="abstract51" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">As conventional computing systems are striving to increase their performance in order to compensate for the growing demand of solving difficult problems, emergent and unconventional computing approaches are being developed to provide alternatives on efficiently solving a plethora of those complex problems. Chemical computers which use chemical reactions as their main characteristic can be strong candidates for these new approaches. Oscillating networks of novel nano-devices like memristors are also able to perform calculations with their rich dynamics and their strong memory and computing features. In this work, the combination of the aforementioned approaches is achieved that capitalizes on the threshold switching mechanism of low-voltage CBRAM devices to establish a memristive oscillating circuitry that is able to act as a chemical reaction - diffusion system through the network nodes' interactions. The propagation of the voltage signals throughout the medium can be used to establish a mechanism for specific logic operations according to the desired logic function leading to the nano-implementation of Margolus chemical wave logic gate.</div>

                    <div id="abstract52" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Computational functionality has been implemented successfully on chemical reactions in living systems. In the case of Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, this was achieved by using collision-based techniques and by exploiting the light sensitivity of BZ. In order to unveil the computational capacity of the light sensitive BZ medium and the possibility to implement re-configurable logic, the design of multiple logic gates in a fixed BZ reservoir was investigated. The three basic logic gates (namely NOT, OR and AND) were studied to prove the Turing completeness of the architecture. Namely, all possible Boolean functions can be implemented as a combination of these logic gates. Nonetheless, a more complicated logic function was investigated, aiming to illustrate further capabilities of a fixed size BZ reservoir. The experiments executed within this study were implemented with a Cellular Automata (CA)-based model of the Oregonator equations that simulate excitation and wave propagation on a light sensitive BZ thin film. Given that conventional or von Neumann architecture computations is proved possible on the proposed configuration, the next step would be the realization of unconventional types of computation, such as neuromorphic and fuzzy computations, where the chemical substrate may prove more efficient than silicon.</div>

                    <div id="abstract53" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">The time series of the brain are usually characterized by the co-existence of synchronized and desynchronized behaviors. This kind of behavior is related to normal and disorderly functions of the brain. One of the suggested mechanisms to understand thoroughly this behavior are chimera states, which are characterized by the coincidence of coherent and incoherent dynamics that can be exploited through networks of symmetrically coupled identical oscillators. In this work, ring-based networks of Chua’s circuits, the simplest electronic oscillators that perform chaotic and well-known bifurcation phenomena, have been extensively studied in memristive crossbars (Xbar), revealing various collective spatio-temporal behaviors, such as chimera states. With respect to different Xbar connectivities and via SPICE-level circuit simulations, the proposed Xbar system proves its efficacy to reproduce spatio-temporal patterns spanning from complete synchronization and chimera states up to fully chaotic states.</div>

                    <div id="abstract54" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Over the last years there has been significant progress in the development of quantum computers. It has been demonstrated that they can accelerate the solution of various problems exponentially compared to today’s classical computers, harnessing the properties of superposition and entanglement, two resources that have no classical analog. Since quantum computer platforms that are currently available comprise only a few tenths of qubits, as well as the access to a fabricated quantum computer is time limited for the majority of researchers, the use of quantum simulators is essential in developing and testing new quantum algorithms. Taking inspiration from previous work on developing a novel quantum simulator based on memristor crossbar circuits, in this work, a framework that automates the circuit design of emulated quantum gates is presented. The proposed design framework deals with the generation and programming of memristor crossbar configuration that incor-porates the desirable quantum circuit, leading to a technology agnostic design tool. To such a degree, various quantum gates can be efficiently emulated on memristor crossbar configurations for various types of memristive devices, aiming to assist and accelerate the fabrication process of a memristor based quantum simulator.</div>

Next, we dope nitride with oxygen in order to introduce and modify the intrinsic nitride defects. Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics reveal that under space-charge limited conditions and by setting the appropriate current compliance, the operation condition of the RRAM cells can be tuned. Furthermore, resistance change can be obtained using appropriate SET/RESET pulsing sequences allowing the use of the devices in computing acceleration application. Impedance spectroscopy measurements clarify the presence of different mechanisms during SET and RESET. We prove through a customized measurement set-up and the appropriate control software that the initial charge-storage in the intrinsic nitride traps governs the resistance change.</div>

                    <div id="abstract59" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) is a promising novel memory technology for non-volatile storing, with low-power operation and ultra-high area density. However, ReRAM memories still face issues through commercialization, mainly owing to the fact that the high fabrication variations and the stochastic switching of the manufactured ReRAM devices cause high Bit Error Rate (BER). Given that ReRAM devices are nonlinear elements, the nonlinear phenomenon of Stochastic Resonance (SR), which defines that an input disturbance with specific characteristics can improve the total performance of the nonlinear system, is used to reduce the ReRAM cell’s BER. Thus, in this brief, the BER of a single ReRAM cell is explored, using the Stanford PKU model, and is improved after the application of specific additive input noise. The power dissipation of the proposed approach is also evaluated and compared with the consideration of higher amplitude writing pulses in the lack of noise, showing that the proposed noise-induced technique can decrease the BER without the excessive increase of the power dissipation. As a first step, towards the experimental verification of the proposed method, noise-induced measurements on a single fabricated ReRAM device are also performed. Overall, the presented results of the BER reduction with low power dissipation, reaching up to \$3.26\times \$ less power consumption considering 100 ns writing pulses, are encouraging for ReRAM designers, delivering a circuit-level solution against the device-level problem.</div>

                    <div id="abstract60" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">True random number generators (TRNG) are key components in information security systems. Moreover, in the era of the internet of things (IoT), the demands on smaller, faster, simpler and more power efficient TRGN circuits increased. Meeting these requirements, resistance switching devices, used also as resistive memory cells (ReRAMs), are attractive candidates to implement entropy sources due to their inherent stochasticity. In this work, we present a novel design of TRNG hardware based on a silicon nitride memristor. Multi-state currents are utilized as different entropy sources increasing the overall entropy of the circuit. A post-processing of the generated bitstreams was made with a simple Xorshift combinational logic circuit. The robustness of the proposed design is verified with NIST randomness tests.</div>

                    <div id="abstract61" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Metal-Insulator-Metal type memristors as emergent nano-electronic devices have been successfully fabricated and used in non-conventional and neuromorphic computing systems in the last years. Several behavioral or physical based models have been developed to explain their operation and to optimize their fabrication parameters. Among them, the resistance switching of the insulating layer due to the formation of conductive filaments is the most well respected and experimentally proven. All existing memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and realism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely characterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical processes are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ quantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model for the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More specifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms forming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament structure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the conductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization of the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate our computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation results successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of memristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data, prove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of multi-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its operation.</div>

                    <div id="abstract62" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">In this work, a versatile mathematical framework for multi-state probabilistic modeling of Resistive Switching (RS) devices is proposed for the first time. The mathematical formulation of memristor and Markov jump processes are combined and, by using the notion of master equations for finite-states, the inherent probabilistic time-evolution of RS devices is sufficiently modeled. In particular, the methodology is generic enough and can be applied for N states; as a proof of concept, the proposed framework is further stressed for both a two-state RS paradigm, namely N = 2, and a multi-state device, namely N = 4. The presented I-V results demonstrate in a qualitative and quantitative manner, adequate matching with other modeling approaches.</div>

                    <div id="abstract63" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Memristor networks are capable of low-power and massive parallel processing and information storage. Moreover, they have presented the ability to apply for a vast number of intelligent data analysis applications targeting mobile edge devices and low power computing. Beyond the memory and conventional computing architectures, memristors are widely studied in circuits aiming for increased intelligence that are suitable to tackle complex problems in a power and area efficient manner, offering viable solutions oftenly arriving also from the biological principles of living organisms. In this paper, a memristive circuit exploiting the dynamics of oscillating networks is utilized for the resolution of very popular and NP-complete logic puzzles, like the well-known “Sudoku”. More specifically, the proposed circuit design methodology allows for appropriate usage of interconnections' advantages in a oscillation network and of memristor's switching dynamics resulting to logic-solvable puzzle-instances. The reduced complexity of the proposed circuit and its increased scalability constitute its main advantage against previous approaches and the broadly presented SPICE based simulations provide a clear proof of concept of the aforementioned appealing characteristics.</div>

                    <div id="abstract64" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">By utilizing biologically inspired approaches, a wide range of complex and computationally intensive problems can be transformed to simpler and more appropriate forms to be easily solved by unconventional computing systems. A well-known computing platform with such characteristics is the Cellular Automata paradigm, where a spatial-extended network of nodes, with local interactions, exhibit emerging computations. In such CA networks, the application of nanodevices, like memristors, with inherent novel abilities, like memory storing and computing capabilities, together with nonlinear interactions is promising for the advancement of computation. In this work, a memristor-based Cellular Automaton (MemCA) is developed for the implementation and optimization of topological chemical logic gates. The proposed MemCA is inspired by the behaviour of the biological organism Physarum Polycephalum that firstly spreads to reach nutrients in its environment and afterwards shrinks to optimize its energy requirements, while performing biochemical oscillations to accomplish these tasks. In a similar way, the MemCA simulates Physarum's spreading to perform the spatial operation of the chemical logic gate, while Physarum's shrinking was utilised to further optimise the required area of the gate.</div>

                    <div id="abstract65" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Memristors are novel non volatile devices that manage to combine storing and processing capabilities in the same physical place. Their nanoscale dimensions and low power consumption enable the further design of various nanoelectronic processing circuits and corresponding computing architectures, like neuromorphic, in memory, unconventional, etc. One of the possible ways to exploit the memristor's advantages is by combining them with Cellular Automata (CA). CA constitute a well known non von Neumann computing architecture that is based on the local interconnection of simple identical cells forming N-dimensional grids. These local interconnections allow the emergence of global and complex phenomena. In this paper, we propose a hybridization of the CA original definition coupled with memristor based implementation, and, more specifically, we focus on Memristive Learning Cellular Automata (MLCA), which have the ability of learning using also simple identical interconnected cells and taking advantage of the memristor devices inherent variability. The proposed MLCA circuit level implementation is applied on optimal detection of edges in image processing through a series of SPICE simulations, proving its robustness and efficacy.</div>

                    <div id="abstract66" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">General purpose processors have been used in a wide variety of computational and modeling applications. However, their performance is not always sufficient when simulating neural networks, which are widely applied to signal processing and pattern recognition. In this work, after a systematic study of the computational requirements of such neural networks and an exploration of the available hardware solutions through which the aforementioned applications can be accelerated, a modern neuromorphic circuit structure is proposed with its operation attributed to memristor devices and segmented crossbar architecture. By coupling these two technologies, neuromorphic circuits have been designed with high computational performance versus integration scale and power consumption. An Ex-Situ training paradigm based on the advantageous memristor segmented crossbar is proposed, using the MNIST dataset and resulting at 97% accuracy. At the same time, a novel memristor tuning method on 1D1M configuration has been developed, able to increase the memristor programming speed.</div>

                    <div id="abstract67" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Cellular Automata (CAs), a ubiquitous computational tool proposed by John von Neumann, illustrate how great complexity emerges from simple rules of dynamical transitions between space and time interconnected simplistic entities. CAs perform as mathematical computation models, but also they are a powerful medium to model nature and natural systems. As a computational platform, CAs come with unified memory and computation in the same physical area, attributed as a strong candidate against the limitations of data transfer, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. On the other hand, Memristors with their inherent Computing-In-Memory compatibility, can be easily considered as appropriate nanoelectronic devices to be coupled with CAs towards an energy and time efficient computational paradigm. In particular, CA present a vast area of applications, comprising various NP-complete hard to be solved problems arriving from computer science field, like the well-known Shortest Path, Bin Packing, Knapsack and Max-clique problems, as well as physical, chemical and biological processes and phenomena, such as epileptic seizures in relation with healthy and pathogenic brain regions and, moreover, real life applications like pseudorandom number generation and simplistic, but with highly complex behavior, models like the famous Game of Life. The outcome of employing Memristors in CAs applications is promising in terms of parallelization, power consumption, scalability, reconfigurability, and high computing performance.</div>

                    <div id="abstract68" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Quantum computing and quantum computers are a major part of the second quantum revolution. Existing quantum algorithms can natively solve complex problems, such as the prime number factorization and searching of unstructured databases, in a fast and efficient way. The main obstacle towards building large and efficient quantum computers is decoherence, which produces errors that have to be continuously corrected using quantum error correcting codes. Beyond the realisation of quantum computing systems with actual quantum hardware, quantum algorithms have been developed based on quantum logic gates that can be described and utilised by classical computers and proper interfaces based on linear algebra operations. Furthermore, memristive grids have been proposed as novel nanoscale and low-power hardware accelerators for the time-consuming matrix-vector multiplication and tensor products. In this work, given that for quantum computations simulation, the matrix-vector multiplication is the dominant algebraic operation, we utilize the unprecedented characteristics of memristive grids to implement circuit-level quantum computations. Since all quantum computations can be mapped to quantum circuits, memristive grids can also be used as efficient quantum simulators, as classical/quantum interfaces and also as accelerators in mixed classical-quantum computing systems.</div>

                    <div id="abstract69" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Memristor networks are capable of low-power, massive parallel processing and information storage. Moreover, they have widely used for a vast number of intelligent data analysis applications targeting mobile edge devices and low power computing. However, till today, one of the major drawbacks resulting to their commercial cumbersome growth, is the fact that the fabricated memristor devices are subject to device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variability that strongly affects the performance of the memristive network and restricts, in a sense, the utilisation of such systems for real-life demanding applications. In this work, we put effort on increasing the performance of memristive networks by incorporating external additive noise that will be proven to have a beneficial role for the memristor devices and networks. More specifically, we are taking inspiration from the well-known non-linear system phenomenon, called Stochastic Resonance, which alleges that noisy signals with specific characteristics can positively affect the operation of non-linear devices. As such, we are now focusing on the utilisation of the phenomenon on memristor devices in a way that the negative effect of variability is reduced, thus the operation of the whole memristor network is assisted by the increased variability tolerance. The presented results of Bit Error Rate (BER) on a small ReRAM crossbar array sound promising and enable us to further investigate the exploitation of the described phenomenon by memristor-based networks and memories.</div>

When some sources of nutrients are present, Physarum connects these sources with its protoplasmic vascular network, along shortest path connections. This chapter presents the modeling of Physarum’s learning and adaptivity to periodic environmental changes by a memristor-based passive LC ﬁlter, and further demonstrates its computational capabilities through two different electronic approaches. Firstly, a circuit-level model of Physarum’s oscillatory internal motion mechanism is designed to emulate the local signal propagation and the expansion of its vascular network during biological shortest path ﬁnding experiments. Furthermore, an extension of this model in a system-level approach is presented, which introduces also the shrinking mechanism that Physarum performs to reduce its power consumption after it has reached every nutrient source within its environment. The proper functioning of both the aforementioned approaches was veriﬁed via circuit simulations in SPICE as well as MATLAB. Finally, the effect of environmental noise was integrated to the presented approaches, permitting their evaluation under more realistic circumstances closer to the biological experiments, with very interesting results.</div>

                    <div id="abstract72" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Memristor devices are two-terminal nanoscale circuit elements that exhibit nonvolatile information storing and can be manufactured in ultra-dense arrays with low-power operation. Although, theoretically, memristors are strong candidates for novel memory and computing applications, the fabricated devices show high variability, both device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle, such as varying switching behaviour and maximum (RMAX) and minimum (RMIN) resistance values. Those limitations in the device's RMAX/RMIN ratio suppress the wide use of memristors in memory or logic applications, thus, this work presents the enhancement of this ratio on actual memristor devices, namely Knowm memristors, due to the introduction of external noise as a beneficial disturbance, following the nonlinear system phenomenon known as Stochastic Resonance.</div>

                    <div id="abstract73" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Since CMOS technology approaches its physical limits, the spotlight of computing technologies and architectures shifts to unconventional computing approaches. In this area, novel computing systems, inspired by natural and mostly nonelectronic approaches, provide also new ways of performing a wide range of computations, from simple logic gates to solving computationally hard problems. Reaction-diffusion processes constitute an information processing method, occurs in nature and are capable of massive parallel and low-power computing, such as chemical computing through Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. In this paper, inspired by these chemical processes and based on the wave-propagation information processing taking place in the reaction-diffusion media, the novel characteristics of the nanoelectronic element memristor are utilized to design innovative circuits of electronic excitable medium to perform both classical (Boolean) calculations and to model neuromorphic computations in the same Memristor-RLC (M-RLC) reconfigurable network.</div>

                    <div id="abstract74" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Stochastic Resonance (SR) is a nonlinear system specific phenomenon, which was demonstrated to lead to system unexpected (counter-intuitive) performance improvements under certain noise conditions. Memristor, on the other hand, is a fundamentally nonlinear circuit element, thus susceptible to benefit from SR, which recently came in the spotlight of the emerging technologies potential candidates. However, at this time, the variability exhibited by manufactured memristor devices within the same array constitutes the main hurdle in the road towards the commercialisation of memristor-based memories and/or computing units. Thus, in this paper, memristor SR effects are explored, assuming various memristor models, and SR-based memristance range enhancement, tolerant to device-to-device variability, is demonstrated. Our experiments reveal that SR can induce significant RMAX/RMIN ratio increase under up to 60% variability, getting as high as 3.4× for 29 dBm noise power.</div>

                    <div id="abstract75" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">In this study, a grid that consists of inductor-capacitor-memristor circuits has been developed to simulate earthquake propagation. The main advantage of the memristor device is its ability to remember its last state even when no voltage is applied to it. Due to this feature, the use of the memristor is favored in the proposed inductor-capacitor-memristor (LCM) circuit. The inductors and capacitors emulate the oscillation of the rocks, whereas the memristors engage the circuit's energy loss and act as the memory that the data affecting the earthquake propagation process is stored. In the context of this study, the proposed circuit model is designed on the LTspice platform. Furthermore, it is tested and validated with real seismic data. Preliminary results are quite encouraging regarding the response of the proposed model.</div>

                    <div id="abstract76" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">In this brief we provide a complete analytical model for the time evolution of the state of a real-world memristor under any dc stimulus and for all initial conditions. The analytical dc model is derived through the application of mathematical techniques to Strachan's accurate mathematical description of a tantalum oxide nano-device from Hewlett Packard Labs. Under positive dc inputs the state equation of the Strachan model can be solved analytically, providing a closed-form expression for the device memory state response. However, to the best of our knowledge, the analytical integration of the state equation of the Strachan model under dc inputs of negative polarity is an unsolved mathematical problem. In order to bypass this issue, the state evolution function is first expanded in a series of Lagrange polynomials, which reproduces accurately the original model predictions on the device off-switching kinetics. The solution to the resulting state equation approximation may then be computed analytically by applying methods from the field of mathematics. Our full analytical model matches both qualitatively and quantitatively the tantalum oxide memristor response captured by the original differential algebraic equation set to typical stimuli of interest such as symmetric and asymmetric pulse excitations. It is further insensitive to the convergence issues that typically arise in the numerical integration of the original model, and may be easily integrated into software programs for circuit synthesis, providing designers with a reliable tool for exploratory studies on the capability of a certain circuit topology to satisfy given design specifications.</div>

                    <div id="abstract77" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">During the last years, Resistive Random-Access Memories (ReRAMs or RRAMs) stimulated growing attention as promising non-volatile (NV) candidate memories to surpass existing storage devices while exhibiting excellent performance, reliability and low-energy operation and in the same time be utilized for unconventional computing paradigms such as neuromorphic and in-memory computation. In this paper, a brief review on the current state of the art for RRAMs is provided mainly focusing on the resistance switching mechanisms for various materials and corresponding devices. More specifically, we report on the switching mechanisms of RRAMs considering resistance bi-stability due to phase transformation, interfacial resistive switching, conductive filaments and thermochemical effects while the effect of environmental conditions like moisture and temperature is also analyzed. Finally, preliminary results related to our on-going investigations on such a type of Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) RRAMs devices derived from Silicon Nitride and compatible with existing CMOS technology are presented and further discussed.</div>

                    <div id="abstract78" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">This paper presents a fully digital implementation of a memristor hardware (HW) simulator, as the core of an emulator, based on a behavioral model of voltage-controlled threshold-type bipolar memristors. Compared to other analog solutions, the proposed digital design is compact, easily reconfigurable, demonstrates very good matching with the mathematical model on which it is based, and complies with all the required features for memristor emulators. We validated its functionality using Altera Quartus II and ModelSim tools targeting low-cost yet powerful field-programmable gate array families. We tested its suitability for complex memristive circuits as well as its synapse functioning in artificial neural networks, implementing examples of associative memory and unsupervised learning of spatiotemporal correlations in parallel input streams using a simplified spike-timing-dependent plasticity. We provide the full circuit schematics of all our digital circuit designs and comment on the required HW resources and their scaling trends, thus presenting a design framework for applications based on our HW simulator.</div>

Manufactured memristors are highly-nonlinear dynamical circuit elements for new future electronics. However the Differential Algebraic Equation sets, used to capture accurately their nonlinear dynamics, typically consist of involved mathematical expressions, which prevent their analytical integration and the derivation of input-output formulas for circuit design. Adopting certain mathematical techniques, we were recently able to derive for the first time, formulas for the DC behaviour of a real-world memristor exhibiting both non-volatility and fading memory. Particularly, on the basis of an accurate mathematical model, this paper presents a set of analytical expressions for the memory state response of a tantalum oxide resistance switching memory, fabricated at the Palo Alto facilities of Hewlett Packard Labs, to any DC stimulus and for all initial conditions.</div>

                    <div id="abstract81" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a zero-player game which belongs to the category of Life-like Cellular Automata (CA), has intrigued researchers from a wide range of scientific areas as it exhibits self organization, the emergence of complex patterns while even implementing a universal Turing machine, despite its simplistic nature. In general, CA is a biologically inspired computational model which is able to approach the behavior of complex natural phenomena by utilizing the locality of interconnected simple elements, namely the CA cells. This work proposes a novel CA cell which exploits the advantages of memristor devices, such as adaptivity and CMOS compatibility, to reproduce the behavior of GoL in circuit-level. Such designs are essential for the development of application specific future electronic systems that will be able to operate in real-time and communicate with other biological systems. The proposed circuit was designed and simulated using the Cadence PSPICE environment.</div>

                    <div id="abstract82" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Cellular Automata (CA) is a nature-inspired and widespread computational model which is based on the collective and emergent parallel computing capability of units (cells) locally interconnected in an abstract brain-like structure. Each such unit, referred as CA cell, performs simplistic computations/processes. However, a network of such identical cells can exhibit nonlinear behavior and be used to model highly complex physical phenomena and processes and to solve problems that are highly complicated for conventional computers. Brain activity has always been considered one of the most complex physical processes and its modeling is of utter importance. This work combines the CA parallel computing capability with the nonlinear dynamics of the memristor, aiming to model brain activity during the epileptic seizures caused by the spreading of pathological dynamics from focal to healthy brain regions. A CA-based confrontation extended to include long-range interactions, combined with the recent notion of memristive electronics, is thus proposed as a modern and promising parallel approach to modeling of such complex physical phenomena. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed design and the appropriate reproduction of the spreading of an epileptic seizure.</div>

                    <div id="abstract83" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Unconventional computing has been studied intensively, even after the appearance of CMOS technology. Currently, it has returned to the spotlight because CMOS is about to reach its physical limits, given that the constant demand for more computational power requires for novel unconventional computing solutions. In this area, the oscillatory internal motion mechanism of slime mould, namely Physarum Polycephalum, could serve as an alternative concept for the design and development of electronic circuits that exploit the memristive dynamics and simple LC contours to deliver solutions for computationally hard to be solved problems. In this direction, this work presents how bio-inspired memristive LC oscillators with a coupling capacitor can be synchronized to perform the functionalities of a biological neuron, also able to execute more complex computations, aiming to model biological neural systems much more advanced than the neuron-less slime mould biological organism. This work proposes a connection between the function mechanism of a simple biological organism and that of complex biological systems, made in a plausible and sufficient manner, towards unconventional computation with memristors.</div>

                    <div id="abstract84" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Memristors promise to revolutionise the world of electronics in the years to come. Besides their most popular applications in the fields of non-volatile memory design and neuro-morphic system development, their ability to process signals and store data in the same physical location may allow the conception of novel mem-computing machines outperforming state-of-the-art hardware systems suffering from the Von Neumann bottleneck. The complexity of real-world memristor models, capturing the inherent nonlinearity of the switching kinetics of the nanodevices, is one of the obstacles towards an extensive exploration of the full potential of memristors in nanoelectronics. It is well-known, in fact, that serious convergence issues frequently arise in the numerical simulation of the differential algebraic equation sets modelling the dynamics of real-world memristors. In this work we propose a strategy to develop a general closed-form mathematical representation of a real-world voltage-controlled memristor manufactured by Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The study aims to derive an analytical formula for the memductance of the nano-device under a general voltage input, starting off from the DC case. This research should be of great benefit to circuit designers, which typically use analytical formulas for the first hands-on calculations in the search for circuit topologies satisfying a certain set of specifications.</div>

                    <div id="abstract85" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Cellular Automata (CAs) is a well-known parallel, bio-inspired, computational model. It is based on the capability of simpler, locally interacting units, i.e. the CAs cells, to evolve in time, giving rise to emergent computation, suitable to model physical system behavior, prediction of natural phenomena and multi-dimensional problem solutions. Moreover, at the same time CAs constitute a promising computing platform, beyond the von Neumann architecture. In this paper, a memristor device is considered to be the basic module of a CA cell circuit implementation, performing as a combined memory and processing element to implement CA-based circuits, able to model sufficiently systems and applications as mentioned above, targeting tentatively to a more energy efficient design compared to the conventional electronics. In particular and as a proof of concept, the results of elementary CAs modeling and simulation for the generation of pseudo-random numbers are presented using a 1-D memristor-based CAs array to illustrate the robustness and the efficacy of the proposed computing approach.</div>

                    <div id="abstract86" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Given the complexity of the mathematical descriptions of real nanodevices with memristor fingerprints, convergence issues often emerge in the simulation of circuits employing memristors, even for a limited number of instances. Actually the simulation of one-memristor circuits may also be troublesome for some inputs and/or initial conditions. This problem prevents a thorough test of memristor circuit designs, representing a severe obstacle towards an extensive use of memristors in electronics. In this work we propose techniques to transform a highly-reliable physics-based model of the Tantalum oxide memristor from Hewlett Packard Labs in a form which lends itself naturally to stable numerical simulations. The results of this study shall pave the way towards a more extensive exploration of the full potential of memristors in integrated circuit design.</div>

                    <div id="abstract87" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Nonlinear circuits may be synchronized with interconnections that evolve in time incorporating mechanisms of adaptation found in many biological systems. Such dynamics in the links is efficiently implemented in electronic devices by using memristors. However, the approach requires a massive amount of interconnections (of the order of N2, where N is the number of nonlinear circuits to be synchronized). This issue is solved in this paper by adopting a memristor crossbar architecture for adaptive synchronization. The functionality of the structure is demonstrated, with respect to different switching characteristics, via a simulation-based evaluation using a behavioral threshold-type model of voltage-controlled bipolar memristor. In addition, we show that the architecture is robust to device variability and faults: quite surprisingly, when faults are localized, the performance of the approach may also improve as adaptation becomes more significant.</div>

                    <div id="abstract88" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">For the first time, the model of a physical nano-scale memristor is integrated analytically. A closed-form expression for the time evolution of the device memristance during the turn-on process is mathematically derived. The complexity of the inverse imaginary error function-based analytical formula clearly reflects the high degree of nonlinearity in the nano-device switching kinetics, which may typically span several orders of magnitude and is critically dependent on input and initial condition. The excellent agreement between the analytical solution and numerical simulation results clearly demonstrates the correctness of the theoretical derivation. The introduction of this formula represents the first step towards a systematic approach to circuit design with memristors.</div>

The computing abilities of slime mould Physarum polycephalum have been used in several applications, including to solve mazes. This work presents a circuit-level bio-inspired maze-solving approach via an electronic model of the oscillatory internal motion mechanism of slime mould, which emulates the local signal propagation and the expansion of its vascular network. Our implementation takes into account the inherent noise existent in the equivalent biological circuit, so that its behavior becomes closer to the non-deterministic behavior of the real organism. The efficiency and generality of the proposed electronic computing medium was validated through SPICE-level circuit simulations and compared with data from two cardinally different biological experiments, concerning 1) enhancing of Physarum's protoplasmic tubes along shortest path and 2) chemo-tactic growth by diffusing chemo-attractants.</div>

                    <div id="abstract91" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Slime mold Physarum polycephalum optimizes its foraging behaviour by minimizing the distances between the sources of nutrients it spans. When two sources of nutrients are present, the slime mold connects the sources, with its protoplasmic tubes, along the shortest path. We present a two-dimensional mesh grid memristor based model as an approach to emulate Physarum’s foraging strategy, which includes space exploration and reinforcement of the optimally formed interconnection network in the presence of multiple aliment sources. The proposed algorithmic approach utilizes memristors and LC contours and is tested in two of the most popular computational challenges for Physarum, namely maze and transportation networks. Furthermore, the presented model is enriched with the notion of noise presence, which positively contributes to a collective behavior and enables us to move from deterministic to robust results. Consequently, the corresponding simulation results manage to reproduce, in a much better qualitative way, the expected transportation networks.</div>

                    <div id="abstract92" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">We propose the use of memristor crossbar for synchronizing nonlinear chaotic circuits. By means of this approach, the nonlinearity and memory features of the memristors are exploited to massively couple the dynamical system units with weights (the state variable of the memristors) which evolve as function of the differences between the state variables of the circuits. In this extended abstract we briefly illustrate the approach and numerical results confirming its suitability.</div>

                    <div id="abstract93" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">FPGAs are reconfigurable electronic platforms, well-suited to implement complex artificial neural networks (ANNs). To this end, the compact hardware (HW) implementation of artificial synapses is an important step to obtain human brain-like functionalities at circuit-level. In this context, the memristor has been proposed as the electronic analogue of biological synapses, but the price of commercially available samples still remains high, hence motivating the development of HW emulators. In this work we present the first digital memristor emulator based upon a voltage-controlled threshold-type bipolar memristor model. We validate its functionality in low-cost yet powerful FPGA families. We test its suitability for complex memristive circuits and prove its synaptic properties in a small associative memory via a perceptron ANN.</div>

                    <div id="abstract94" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">This paper presents a Fuzzy Cellular Automata (FCA) model with the aim to cope with the computational complexity and data uncertainties that characterize the simulation of wildﬁre spreading on real landscapes. Moreover, parallel implementations of the proposed FCA model, on both GPU and FPGA, are discussed and investigated. According to the results, the parallel models exhibit signiﬁcant speedups over the corresponding sequential algorithm. As a possible application, the proposed model could be embedded on a portable electronic system for real-time prediction of ﬁre spread scenarios.</div>

                    <div id="abstract95" class="abstract-content" style="display:none;">Within an ever-increasing variety of applications for memristors, adaptive electronic circuits have attracted considerable attention lately. This paper extends previously published work on memristive filter design to include the potential of composite memristive devices as damping elements in LC-based sensing circuits. The collective response of several LC contours with different memristive damping is considered. A thorough study of the circuit properties is performed in an attempt to exploit the high sensitivity of the circuit, other than address it as a typical drawback. The simulated circuits could find application in bio-inspired information processing, whereas could lead to better behavioral models for biological organisms.</div>
