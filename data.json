The proposed Fuzzy CA (FCA) model adopts a data-driven approach, based on evolutionary optimization, which allows incorporating knowledge from real wildfires in order to enhance its accuracy. The main difficulty for doing so arrives from the computational complexity of the proposed framework and the burden of computational resources needed for its application, which would prevent the real-time prediction of fire spread scenarios.

Such dynamics in the links is efficiently implemented in electronic devices by using memristors. However, the approach requires a massive amount of interconnections (of the order of N2, where N is the number of nonlinear circuits to be synchronized). This issue is solved in this paper by adopting a memristor crossbar architecture for adaptive synchronization. The functionality of the structure is demonstrated, with respect to different switching characteristics, via a simulation-based evaluation using a behavioral threshold-type model of voltage-controlled bipolar memristor. In addition, we show that the architecture is robust to device variability and faults: quite surprisingly, when faults are localized, the performance of the approach may also improve as adaptation \u2026",
